# Overcoming Barriers to Enable Convergence Research by Integrating Ecological and Climate Sciences

This repository contains scripts/notebooks to create figures and reproduce the calculations presented in the paper (Overcoming barriers to enable convergence research by integrating ecological and climate sciences by Lombardozzi et al. 2023). The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource and learning tool for creating high-quality figures in support of this research paper.

## Contents

The repository includes the following notebooks for re-creating plots and tables:

figure1.py: This script generates Figure 1 of the paper, which is a line plot showing the results of an experiment.

Besides that, this repository include the following scripts for pre-processing files:

## To reproduce these calculations:


1. First, clone the repository:

```
git clone neon_scripts
```

2. Build Conda Python environments:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate neon_paper
```

3. Set paths for input data and model data, or alternatively run the preprocessor notebook. 

4. Follow the steps in each notebook to create the plots.
